Crafty â€“ build HTML like a craftsman
====================================

Crafty allows you to easily and flexibly craft HTML output with pure Ruby
code. It is inspired by Builder and Markaby, but is simpler and more flexible.
Its goal is to provide simple helpers that allow you to build HTML markup in
any class.


Features
--------

* Crafty is simple and fast.

* HTML element sets are predefined and provided as mix-ins.

* Automatic HTML output escaping, 100% compatible with Rails.

* No `instance_eval` or `method_missing` tricks, just helper methods.


Synopsis
--------

    require "crafty"

    class Widget
      include Crafty::HTML::Basic

      def initialize(target)
        @target = target
      end

      def render
        html do
          head do
            title "Hello"
          end
          body do
            render_content
          end
        end
      end

      def render_content
        div class: "main" do
          p "Hello, #{@target}!"
        end
      end
    end

    Widget.new("world").render
    #=> "<html><head><title>Hello</title></head><body><div class=\"main\"><p>Hello, world!</p></div></body></html>"
